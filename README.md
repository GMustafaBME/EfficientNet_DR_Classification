# EfficientNetB7 for Diabetic Retinopathy Classification

This repository contains code for training and testing an **EfficientNetB7** deep learning model on the **APTOS 2019** dataset for diabetic retinopathy classification.

## 📌 Features
- **EfficientNetB7** model for classification.
- **Preprocessing pipeline**: Cropping, resizing, and enhancement.
- **Training script**: Trains the model on the APTOS 2019 dataset.
- **Testing script**: Evaluates the model on a test dataset.
- **Prediction saving**: Outputs test predictions in a CSV file.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/EfficientNet_DR_Classification.git
cd EfficientNet_DR_Classification
2️⃣ Install required dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(You may need to manually install TensorFlow, OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy, etc.)

3️⃣ Download and organize the dataset:

Place the APTOS 2019 dataset inside the /dataset folder.
Ensure CSV files (train.csv, test.csv) and images are correctly located.
🚀 Training the Model
Run the following command to train EfficientNetB7:

sh
Copy code
python train_script.py
This script:

Loads and preprocesses images.
Splits data into train/validation sets.
Trains EfficientNetB7.
Saves the trained model as efficientnetb7_model.h5.
🎯 Testing the Model
Run the following command to evaluate on the test dataset:

sh
Copy code
python test_script.py
This script:

Loads the test dataset.
Preprocesses images.
Loads the trained model.
Predicts labels and saves them in test_predictions.csv.
📜 Dataset Information
Dataset: APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection
Input: Retinal fundus images (PNG format)
Output: Classification into 5 stages of diabetic retinopathy
⚡ Future Improvements
✅ Add fine-tuning for improved accuracy
✅ Deploy the model as a web app
